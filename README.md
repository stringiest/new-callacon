# Callacon
Callacon is a gaming holiday held twice a year in Matlock. There are around 50 attendees. A committee takes bookings, collects payments, allocates accommodation and schedules games. 

This app initially seeks to automate some of the administrative tasks around bookings.

## Dev setup notes
(to follow)  

## MVP
Initial version of the app should mimic the current google form user booking experience, but automate the booking-related communications currently sent manually by the committee.  

### Booking workflow
1. User adds new booking, including requirements.
2. App sends user automatic email confirmation of booking, detailing all options selected.
3. App prompts admin to add cost to booking (not yet discussed whether this is an email to committee for each booking, a periodic email, an admin dashboard showing new or amended bookings)
4. Admin updates booking with cost and description of cost.
5. App sends user email advising of amount payable.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
